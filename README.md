# raffleez

Full-stack web application that allows users to create raffles and participate in existing raffles. With  React I created a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create raffles ,view existing raffles and also allows users to participate in raffles.With Node.js and Express I created a RESTful API that manages the creation and participation of raffles and also has an email notification system that sends email to each participant with raffle's result. I also integrated MongoDB to store and manage raffle data.
